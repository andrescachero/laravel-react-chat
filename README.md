## Laravel + React + Pusher chat room

This is a very simple project. Built using Laravel's different features like Events, Broadcasting, Authentication and integration with Pusher. For the fron-end I choose React, built using Laravel Mix (wrapper for webpack)

## To run the app

-   Open one terminal and run PHP server

    > > php artisan serve

-   Open another terminal and run webpack
    > > php artisan watch
